TanStack Themes for React is published as `@tanstack-themes/react` and works in Node, Bun, and Deno environments.

> This package is ESM-only and requires a `tsconfig.json` with a module resolution that understands `package.json#exports` (for example: `moduleResolution: "NodeNext"` for `tsc`, or `moduleResolution: "Bundler"` when using a bundler).

## Install the package

- **Node / Bun**

```bash
npx nypi @tanstack-themes/react
```

- **Deno**

```bash
deno add jsr:@tanstack-themes/react
```

## Peer dependencies

TanStack Themes for React expects these peer dependencies in your project:

- **`react`**: `^18.2.0 || ^19.0.0`
- **`@tanstack/react-router`**: `^1.130`
- **`@tanstack/react-start`**: `^1.130`
- **`@tanstack/react-store`**

If you already have a TanStack Start app, you likely have these installed.

## Quick sanity check

After installation, you should be able to import from the package:

```tsx
import {
  ThemeProvider,
  useTheme,
  setTheme,
  setVariant,
  THEME_MODES,
} from "@tanstack-themes/react";

function Example() {
  const theme = useTheme();
  return <span>Current mode: {theme.themeMode}</span>;
}
```
