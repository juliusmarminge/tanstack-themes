TanStack Themes for React gives you a single source of truth for theme mode (`light`, `dark`, `auto`) and variants (e.g. `default`, `t3chat`, `catpuccin`) in your TanStack Start app.

It ships a tiny client-side store, helpers to wire up `<html>` / `<body>` attributes, and utilities to keep your `<meta name="theme-color">` tags in sync.

## Why use TanStack Themes?

- **First-class TanStack Start support**: Works with `@tanstack/react-router` and `@tanstack/react-start` out of the box.
- **Strongly typed variants**: Declare your own theme variants once in TypeScript and use them everywhere.
- **Automatic meta theme-color**: Keep the browser address bar & PWA shell in sync with your current theme.

## What you get

- **`ThemeProvider`**: Hydrates and keeps the theme store in sync between server and client.
- **`useTheme`**: Access the current theme mode, resolved scheme, and variant from any component.
- **`setTheme`, `setVariant`, `THEME_MODES`**: Imperative helpers and constants to drive your own UI.
- **`useHtmlAttributes`, `useBodyAttributes`**: Optional hooks to generate attributes for `<html>` and `<body>`.
- **`getThemeColorMetaTags`**: Generates `<meta name="theme-color">` tags for your route head.
